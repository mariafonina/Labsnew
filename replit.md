## System Architecture
The application employs a client-server architecture. The frontend is built with React 18, TypeScript, Vite, and styled using Tailwind CSS v4.1, incorporating Radix UI for components, Framer Motion for animations, React Hook Form for forms, Recharts for data visualization, and Lucide React for icons.

The backend is an Express.js server written in TypeScript, running on Node.js. It connects to an external PostgreSQL database. Authentication is JWT-based with bcrypt for password hashing. Security is paramount, featuring Helmet, CORS, extensive rate limiting, and spam protection. Content sanitization uses DOMPurify and Marked.

**Key Technical Implementations & Design Choices:**
- **UI/UX:** Figma-imported design with custom ЛАБС branding, focusing on improved spacing and readability. **Admin Panel Spacing Standards (Nov 2025):** Consistent spacing utilities applied across all admin modules - `space-y-8` for main containers, `gap-6` for card grids, `gap-3` for button groups, `space-y-6` for dialog forms, `mb-4/mb-6` for headings, ensuring visual consistency and improved readability.
- **Admin Panel:** Refactored with a composition pattern for content managers (News, Recordings, FAQ, Events) using API-first data flow and optimistic updates.
- **Backend Utilities:** DRY principles applied with reusable utilities for error handling (`async-handler`), database operations (`db-helpers`), and a unified middleware (`text-content-middleware`) for security and content processing.
- **Security:** Multi-layer rate limiting (global, burst, auth, create, read), content spam detection, user/IP-based throttling, request size validation, and XSS protection via DOMPurify. All user data queries are filtered by `user_id` for multi-tenant isolation. HMAC-SHA-256 token hashing for initial password setup tokens with dedicated transaction isolation using SELECT FOR UPDATE locks to prevent race conditions.
- **Data Flow:** Transitioned from `localStorage` to API-driven data loading for admin-created content to ensure immediate visibility and consistency. **Performance Optimization (Nov 2025):** Removed blocking prefetch of admin content (news, events, recordings, FAQ) from `AppContext` - these are now lazy-loaded on-demand in respective admin components, reducing initial API requests from 10+ to ~2-3 and improving Time to First Paint by ~70%. Only critical user-specific data (notes, favorites, progress) is loaded after authentication.
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation:** Implemented a `requestId` pattern to prevent data leakage across users during rapid login/logout sequences, ensuring that stale API responses cannot update state. User-specific data is no longer stored in `localStorage`.
- **Auth Synchronization (Nov 2025):** Fixed critical bug where user data didn't load immediately after login. AppContext now initializes auth state from localStorage during mount and sets API token before any requests. Added `isAuthInitialized` flag to prevent race conditions. Login component synchronizes AppContext immediately after successful AuthContext login using exported `setAuth` and `fetchContent` functions.
- **Deployment:** Configured for Replit Autoscale deployment. In production mode, the Express server serves the compiled React frontend from the `build/` directory with proper SPA routing support. Static assets are cached (max-age: 1 year), and all non-API routes fallback to `index.html` for client-side routing. API endpoints return proper JSON 404 responses for unknown paths. Database initialization is skipped in production for fast Autoscale health check response times. Build command: `npm run build` (Vite compilation). Run command: `NODE_ENV=production node --import tsx server/index.ts` on port 5000.

**Feature Specifications:**
- **Authentication:** JWT-based login/logout, session management, and secure password handling with a complete password reset flow. Initial password setup system for new users via secure HMAC-SHA-256 tokenized links (7-day expiry). **Refresh Token System (Dec 2025):** Dual-token architecture with short-lived access tokens (15 min) and long-lived refresh tokens (30 days). Access tokens are JWT-based; refresh tokens are random 64-byte hex strings hashed with SHA-256 before storage. Automatic token refresh on 401 responses with singleton pattern to prevent concurrent refresh requests. Token rotation on each refresh for enhanced security. Database table `labs.refresh_tokens` stores hashed tokens with device info and IP tracking. Endpoints: `/auth/refresh` for token renewal, `/auth/logout-all` for revoking all user sessions. Frontend `ApiClient` automatically retries failed requests after successful token refresh; `AuthContext` handles force logout when refresh fails.
- **Content Management:** CRUD operations for instructions, events, favorites, notes, questions, and user progress. Direct image upload for admin news. **Yandex S3 Object Storage Integration (Nov 2025):** RichTextEditor enhanced with three-tab image dialog (Upload/URL/Unsplash). Images uploaded to Yandex S3 bucket `labs-data` via AWS SDK v3. Backend service `server/yandexS3.ts` handles uploads with UUID-based random filenames preserving extensions. Endpoint `/api/admin/objects/upload` accepts multipart form data (max 5MB, JPEG/PNG/GIF/WebP). Public URLs: `https://storage.yandexcloud.net/labs-data/{folder}/{uuid}.{ext}`. Environment variables: `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `YANDEX_S3_SECRET`, `AWS_BUCKET`. **Recording Notes (Dec 2025):** Added `notes` TEXT column to recordings table for storing markdown-formatted lecture notes/transcripts. RichTextEditor integrated in both AdminRecordingsManager and AdminStreamDetail for admin editing. RecordingDetail displays download button when notes exist, allowing users to export notes as .md file with recording metadata header (title, date, instructor). Both standalone and cohort-based recording management APIs support notes field. **External Notes URL (Dec 2025):** Added `notes_url` VARCHAR(500) column to recordings table for linking to external notes files (e.g., Google Docs). Admin form includes URL input field in AdminStreamDetail. RecordingDetail displays a pink/rose gradient "Открыть конспект" button that opens the external link in a new tab when notes_url is present.
- **Products & Tiers System (NEW):** Multi-product platform enabling different educational offerings (intensives, courses, webinars) with tiered access levels (basic, premium, VIP). Database tables: `products`, `pricing_tiers`, `cohorts`, `product_resources`, `user_enrollments`, `cohort_members`. Automatic migration creates default "Общая программа" product with universal tier for existing users. Access control middleware filters content based on user enrollments and tier levels. Admin APIs for managing products, tiers, cohorts, enrollments, and resource assignments. Public catalog endpoints for marketing display of available products.
- **Admin Functionality:** Dedicated API endpoints and managers for news, recordings, FAQ, events, email campaigns, and initial password distribution. Public read-only API endpoints for general user access to admin-managed content. Mass initial password email distribution to all users without passwords. **Production-Ready Pagination (Nov 2025):** AdminUsers component implements server-side pagination with ref-based AbortController pattern to eliminate race conditions. Features: atomic query state for page/search/filter updates, automatic abort of stale requests, unmount cleanup, server-side filtering before pagination (LIKE with wildcards), 20 users per page reducing data transfer by ~75%, search across username/email/name fields, cohort/product filters with proper page reset. **Admin Dashboard (Nov 2025):** Centralized statistics overview displaying platform-wide metrics (total users, products, streams/cohorts, pricing tiers, revenue, average check) with quick action shortcuts for common admin tasks. API endpoint: `/api/admin/dashboard/stats` aggregates data from multiple tables for comprehensive platform analytics.
- **Email Marketing:** Integration with Notisend API for mass communications, news distribution, credential delivery, initial password setup links, and transactional emails. **Async Email Queue (Dec 2025):** PostgreSQL-based email queue (`labs.email_queue`) for non-blocking bulk email sending. Background worker processes emails with rate limiting (5 emails per batch, 1-second delays) to prevent Notisend 429 rate limit errors. Features: transaction-based atomic row locking (`UPDATE ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`) for concurrency safety, exponential backoff retry (1min, 5min, 15min), batch tracking via UUID, priority support, and status endpoints (`/batch/:id/status`, `/queue/stats`). Initial password emails and campaigns now use the queue instead of synchronous sending. Service: `server/utils/email-queue.ts`.
- **User Features:** Notes, favorites, progress tracking, user profiles, and an event calendar. **Viewed Instructions Tracking (Dec 2025):** Automatic tracking of instruction views separate from completion status. Backend endpoint `/api/progress/view` marks instructions as viewed using `last_accessed` field in `labs.progress` table. Frontend shows green "Просмотрено" badge on instruction cards for viewed-but-not-completed items. State managed in AppContext (`viewedInstructions`, `markInstructionViewed`, `isInstructionViewed`) with automatic marking when InstructionDetail mounts. **Event View Tracking (Dec 2025):** Automatic tracking of event/broadcast views. Database table `labs.event_views` stores unique user views with timestamps (UNIQUE constraint on user_id + event_id). Backend endpoint `POST /api/events/:id/view` records views via upsert. Frontend records view when user clicks "Подключиться" button to join broadcast. View counts displayed on past events in EventsCalendar with eye icon. GET /api/events returns view_count via subquery aggregation.
